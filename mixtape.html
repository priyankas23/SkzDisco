      <p> Mixtape is Stray Kids' pre-debut EP. Released in 2018, this album has seven songs, all of which were performed on Stray Kids' survival show that formed their group. Despite some of the song being unit songs performed with only a few members (4419, School Life, GLOW), all songs in the album are performed by all the members of Stray Kids at the time. All songs were self-produced by 3racha, the three members of Stray Kids who produce music (Bang Chan, Changbin, Han).</p>
